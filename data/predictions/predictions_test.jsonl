{"ID": "oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:53448", "TITLE": "Climate business for poverty reduction? The role of the World Bank", "ABSTRACT": "The World Bank is increasingly active in the area of climate change mitigation. While it justifies this engagement with its poverty reduction objective and its capacity to pave the way for new business activities in developing countries, critics blame the World Bank as a “climate profiteer” and as an unfair competitor in private markets. Our econometric analysis of over 2,000 projects registered until May 2010 under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol allows us to compare the activities of the Bank with those of other, primarily private actors. The results indicate that hardly any of the CDM projects can be considered as strongly pro-poor. Nevertheless, in comparison to the rest of the CDM projects, the Bank’s portfolio shows a relatively clearer orientation towards poor countries. Within these countries, however, the Bank does not show any particular pro-poor focus, and tends to implement those projects that are commercially most attractive. Moreover, there is no evidence of the Bank phasing out its activities once the market becomes fully operational, which goes against its professed pioneering and catalytic role in carbon markets.", "URL": "https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/53448", "SGD": 0}
{"ID": "oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:108257", "TITLE": "On a long neglected player: The religious dimension in poverty alleviation. The example of the so-called ‘Prosperity Gospel’ in Africa", "ABSTRACT": "Much of poverty alleviation theory and practice fails to sufficiently consider the following crucial factor: the religious dimension. This paper elaborates this thesis by focusing on the African context and the valuable resources African religious communities and movements can provide in the struggle against poverty. One particularly influential streak of present-time African religiousness serves as a case study: the so-called ‘Prosperity Gospel’ as part of Pentecostal Christianity. The author first argues for the continuing formative influence of religion on African conceptions of self, other, and world. Secondly, she provides a critical assessment of the impact of Pentecostalism and the ‘Prosperity Gospel’ on poverty alleviation. In comparison with secular ngos, Pentecostal churches emerge as the more effective agents of change. A third part situates the insights gained into a wider perspective, seeking ways to integrate the religious factor into a more holistic conception of and engagement against poverty.", "URL": "https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/108257", "SGD": 2}
{"ID": "oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:51540", "TITLE": "Knowledge is power: A theory of information, income, and welfare spending", "ABSTRACT": "No voters cast their votes based on perfect information, but better educated and richer voters are on average better informed than others. We develop a model where the voting mistakes resulting from low political knowledge reduce the weight of poor voters, and cause parties to choose political platforms that are better aligned with the preferences of rich voters. In US election survey data, we find that income is more important in affecting voting behavior for more informed voters than for less informed voters, as predicted by the model. Further, in a panel of US states we fi*nd that when there is a strong correlation between income and political information, Congress representatives vote more conservatively, which is also in line with our theory.", "URL": "https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/51540", "SGD": 1}
